# l1j-en

l1j-en is an English-language server emulator for the South Korean MMORPG,
Lineage 1.  It targets feature-complete support for the final US release of the
client (S3ep1, also called Tikal/Antharas).

See the project documentation on the
[l1j-en project wiki](https://code.l1j.org/l1j/classic/wikis/home) for general
project info, the client connector, FAQ, and the setup guide.

If you need any help, contact our
[mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/l1j-en) or hop on the
channel #l1j on Freenode IRC.

### Recent History

This repo started as a direct copy of the l1j-en project on Google Code as of
their revision 726.  We pulled upstream updates from l1j-jp2 but since have
diverged significantly.

As of March 2014, everial's downstream fork was merged back into master.  As of
June 2014, this and the Google Code repo are synced, with the GitHub version
typically getting fixes first.

As of 2018, the Google Code repository (and any related repos there) is to be
considered abandoned as Google has long since shut down that service.  We're
also now off of GitHub and hosted here at l1j.org.

### Contributing

Report issues and suggest features and improvements on the
[l1j.org issue tracker](https://code.l1j.org/l1j/classic/issues). Discussions and questions
should go to the mailing list and IRC channel.

Pull requests are always welcome!  For those migrating to Git from SVN, see the
[DEVGUIDE](https://github.com/l1j/en/blob/master/DEVGUIDE.md).

Those interested in joining the development effort as a team member should feel
free to let us know, preferably on the IRC channel.  We always need additional
help with programming, Lineage 1 domain knowledge (particularly with newer
game content), and documentation.
