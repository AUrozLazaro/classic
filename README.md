# l1j-en

l1j-en is an English-language server emulator for the South Korean MMORPG,
Lineage 1.  It targets feature-complete support for the final US release of the
client (S3ep1, also called Tikal/Antharas).

See the project documentation on the
[l1j-en project on Google Code](http://code.google.com/p/l1j-en) for general
project info, the client connector, FAQ, and the
[Setup Guide](https://code.google.com/p/l1j-en/wiki/SetupGuide).  There is also
a currently in-progress [Project Wiki](https://github.com/l1j/en/wiki) hosted
here.

If you need any help, contact our
[mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/l1j-en) or hop on the
channels #l1j or #l1j-dev on Freenode IRC.


### Recent History

This repo started as a direct copy of the l1j-en project on Google Code as of
their revision 726.  We pulled upstream updates from l1j-jp2 but since have
diverged significantly.

As of March 2014, everial's downstream fork was merged back into master.  As of
June 2014, this and the Google Code repo are synced, with this GitHub version
typically getting fixes first.

### Supporting Projects

[l1j-en project on Google Code](http://code.google.com/p/l1j-en): The original
upstream for this repo.  Since then, the roles have been reversed.

[l1j-vagrant](https://github.com/phuedx/l1j-vagrant): Provides one option for
an easy, standardized environment setup.

[l1j-client](https://github.com/uglyoldbob/l1j-client): An attempt to create an
open source client for L1J.  Note that this is in-progress and the official
client is still currently recommended.

Let us know if you start an English l1j-related project and we'll add it here.
Interest currently exists for starting an open-source connector project.
