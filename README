For general info about l1j-en, see the main github page.

This branch differs from mainline l1j-en in a couple of big ways:

- abandons the "no-refactor" goal - I clean things as I come across them.
- gpl v2 instead of v3.

In general it's as usable as mainline l1j-en; at least one stable server (WK)
is using it.
