For general info about l1j-en, see the main github page.

This branch differs from mainline l1j-en in a couple of big ways:

- abandons the "no-refactor" goal - I clean things as I come across them, though
I've constrained myself to individual files for now. While this violates every 
style guide in existence, it's useful to me since it immediately identifies any
section of the code I've touched. It's also been good practice. This would be
much more of an issue if anyone else was still working on a publicly accessible
branch of l1j-en or one of the other language forks.

- gpl v2 instead of gpl v3.

In general it's as usable as mainline l1j-en; at least one stable server (WK)
is using it. Anything WK specific is handled in separate db files or has config
options.
