Please commit all changes to the development branch first (other than your own local branches), and from their let them follow up through testing in to main.

Please make commit's as "small" as possible, one change (or complete feature) per commit.  This will make testing and maintanance much easier.

Command cheat sheet:

#grab a local copy of the repo

git clone git://github.com/l1j/en.git (read-only)
git clone https://tricid@github.com/l1j/en.git (if you're a developer with access)

#update repo

svn update

git pull

#checkout a remote branch (ones that everyone can see)
git checkout -b development origin/development

#create a branch named thebes (local only, the rest of us cant see this)
git branch thebes

#commit changes
svn commit

git commit -a (commits them to your local copy)

#merge changes in to branch named thebes in to branch development
git checkout development
git merge thebes
git push (pushes the changes upstream for all to see)
